Dear Cohesion Members,

  - Please write your commit messages in simple present tense in third person view - the TA told me to do so. According to him, it looks more professional.
  - Please write javadocs for your codes ASAP.
  - PLEASE REMEMBER TO INCLUDE THE STRING "TEST" IN YOUR TESTING CODES IN ORDER TO LET THE GIT IGNORE THEM.

Sincerely,
Ege Balcýoðlu
